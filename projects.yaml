title: "Presence: Sci-Fi VR Experience"

  This was a 6 week project for the Victoria University of Wellington School of Design in 2016.
  The theme for the project was "presence", which I took literally and created this VR experience set in a grungy futuristic apartment.
  Viewed on an Oculus Rift and controlled with a Leap Motion controller.
